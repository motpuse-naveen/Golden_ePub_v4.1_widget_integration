   <p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>

<h2 class="h1hd" id="ST0010">Abstract</h2>
<p class="abspara">The cardiac hormone, B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), is one of human natriuretic peptides which possesses cardiorenal protective actions and is used as a therapeutic and a biomarker for heart failure (HF). Its prohormone, proBNP<sub>1&#8211;108</sub>, is processed by the proNPs convertases, corin or furin, to inactive NT-proBNP<sub>1&#8211;76</sub> and active BNP<sub>1&#8211;32</sub>. Paradoxically, circulating NT-proBNP and BNP are elevated in HF leading to the use of BNP as a sensitive and predictive marker of HF. This paradox may be explained by the &#8220;nonspecific&#8221; nature of conventional assays and/or a relative deficiency state of &#8220;active BNP&#8221; as characterized by an increase in inactive proBNP<sub>1&#8211;108</sub> and a decrease in active BNP<sub>1&#8211;32</sub>. Therefore, understanding the regulation of proBNP<sub>1&#8211;108</sub> processing and the role of the convertase corin may be important in understanding the physiology of HF. Corin is expressed in heart and kidney and may play an important role in regulating blood pressure and remodeling of the heart. The processing of proBNP<sub>1&#8211;108</sub> by corin may be controlled by O-linked glycosylation of proBNP<sub>1&#8211;108</sub>. A potential impairment of proBNP<sub>1&#8211;108</sub> processing in HF may be linked to dysregulation of the convertase corin, which may offer therapeutic opportunities to control proBNP<sub>1&#8211;108</sub> processing and its activation in HF.</p>

<p id="P0520" class="textfl">The material in this chapter should be cross-referenced with the following cases: <b>Investment Banking in 2008 (A)</b> and <b>Investment Banking in 2008 (B).</b></p>
<p id="P0525" class="text">Investment banking changed dramatically during the 20-year period preceding the global financial crisis that started during mid-2007, as market forces pushed banks from their traditional low-risk role of advising and intermediating to a position of taking considerable risk for their own account and on behalf of clients. This high level of risk-taking, combined with high leverage, transformed the industry during 2008, when several major firms failed, huge trading losses were recorded, and all large firms were forced to reorganize their business.</p>
<p id="P0530" class="text">Risk-taking activities of investment banks were reduced following large losses that stemmed primarily from mortgage-related assets, bad loans, and an overall reduction in revenues due to the financial crisis. This led to an industry-wide effort to reduce leverage ratios and a string of new equity capital issuances. By the end of 2008, five U.S.-headquartered &#8220;pure-play&#8221; investment banks (which did not operate deposit-taking businesses, unlike large &#8220;universal&#8221; banks such as JPMorgan Chase, which operated a large investment bank, a deposit-taking business, and other businesses) had undergone significant transformations: Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley converted into bank holding companies; the U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed) pushed Bear Stearns into the arms of <b><span class="anychar dropdown def-img anychar-tooltip pos-up" aria-label="m dash" tabindex="0" role="button" data-dfn="BIBu1">J.P. Morgan (1990)</span></b> to avoid a bankruptcy; Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy protection after the Fed and Treasury Department ignored its pleas for government support; and Merrill Lynch, presumably to avoid a similar bankruptcy filing, agreed to sell their firm to Bank of America at a substantial discount to historical prices (see <a href="#B0010">Box 1.1</a>).</p>

<p id="P0535" class="text">Historically, through 1999, U.S. banks with deposit-taking businesses (commercial/retail banks) were barred from operating investment banking businesses. This rule was created by the Glass-Steagall Banking Act of 1933, which was enacted after the stock market crash of 1929 to protect depositors&#8217; assets. In 1999, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act overturned the requirement to keep investment banks and commercial banks separate, and led to the formation of U.S.-headquartered universal investment banks, including J.P. Morgan, Citigroup, and Bank of America. Two of the main arguments for rejoining these two businesses were (1) to provide for a more stable and countercyclical business model for these banks, and (2) to allow U.S. banks to better compete with international counterparts (e.g., UBS, Credit Suisse, and Deutsche Bank) that were less encumbered by the Glass-Steagall Act. As a result, Citigroup, which was created through the 1998 merger of Citicorp and Travelers Group (which owned the investment bank Salomon Brothers), did not have to divest Salomon Brothers in order to comply with federal regulations. J.P. Morgan and Bank of America followed the lead of Citigroup in combining businesses to create universal investment banks. These universal banks rapidly developed a broad-based investment banking business, hiring many professionals from pure-play <span id="page_2" aria-label="Page 2" epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak"/>investment banks and strategically using their significant lending capability as a platform from which they were able to capture investment banking market share.<b><span class="anychar dropdown def-img anychar-tooltip pos-up" aria-label="m dash" tabindex="0" role="button" data-dfn="BIB1"><sup>1</sup></span></b> <span class="anychar dropdown def-img anychar-tooltip pos-up" aria-label="m dash" tabindex="0" role="button" data-dfn="bib_B1">Cyriax J.

<h2 class="h1hd" id="ST0040">Investment Banking Businesses</h2>
<p id="P0550" class="textfl">Although each investment bank takes a somewhat different approach, the basic businesses of most large investment banks consist of (a) an investment banking business managed by the Investment Banking Division that principally focuses on capital raising <span id="page_5" aria-label="Page 5" epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak"/>and mergers and acquisitions (M&#38;A) transactions for corporate clients and capital raising for government clients; (b) a sales and trading business managed by the Trading Division that provides investing, intermediating, and risk-management services to institutional investor clients, research, and also participates in nonclient-related investing activities; and (c) an asset management business managed by the Asset Management Division that is responsible for managing money for individual and institutional investing clients (see <a href="#F0015">Figure 1.2</a>).</p>
<p id="P0555" class="text">Within the nine large global investment banks, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley are examples of more narrowly focused investment banks.

However, they do not participate in the noninvestment banking businesses that the other global firms conduct. JPMorgan Chase (whose investment banking business is separately branded as J.P.

<h2 class="h1hd" id="ST0045">Investment Banking Division</h2>
<p id="P0560" class="textfl">The Investment Banking Division of an investment bank is responsible for working with corporations that seek to raise capital through public or private capital markets, risk-manage their existing capital, or complete an M&#38;A-related transaction. In addition, at some firms, this division has increasingly provided financing through direct investments in corporate equity and debt securities, and provided loans to corporate clients. Finally, <span id="page_6" aria-label="Page 6" epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak"/>this division helps government-related entities raise funds and manage risk. Individuals who work in the Investment Banking Division are called &#8220;bankers&#8221; and are assigned to work in either a product group or a client coverage group. The two key product groups are M&#38;A and Capital Markets. Within the M&#38;A product group, bankers typically specialize by industry (and at some investment banks, they work within the industry coverage group).</p>
<p id="P0565" class="text">Within the Capital Markets Group, bankers specialize by working in either Debt Capital Markets or equity capital markets. Client coverage bankers are usually organized into industry groups, which typically focus on the following industries: healthcare, consumer, industrials, retail, energy, chemicals, financial institutions, real estate, financial sponsors, media and telecom, and technology and public finance, among others (see Exhibit 1.3). Exhibit 1.4 provides a summary of the product groups in Morgan Stanley&#8217;s Investment Banking Division.</p>
<section>
<div id="S0045">
<h3 class="h2hd" id="ST0050">Client Coverage Bankers</h3>
<p id="P0570" class="textfl">Bankers assigned to industry teams are required to become global experts in the industry and understand the strategic and financing objectives of their assigned companies. They help CEOs and CFOs focus on corporate strategic issues such as how to enhance <span id="page_7" aria-label="Page 7" epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak"/>shareholder value. This sometimes leads to an M&#38;A transaction in which clients sell the company or buy another company. These bankers also help companies to achieve an optimal capital structure, with the appropriate amount of cash and debt on their balance sheet. This often leads to a capital markets transaction in which the company issues equity or debt, or repurchases outstanding securities. In short, client coverage bankers develop an in-depth understanding of a company&#8217;s problems and objectives (within the context of their industry) and deliver the full resources of the investment bank in an effort to assist their clients. They are the key relationship managers and provide a centralized point of contact for corporate clients of the investment bank.</p>
<p id="P0575" class="text">A financing or M&#38;A assignment usually results in a partnership between client coverage bankers and product bankers to execute the transaction for a corporate client. Other investment banking services can also be introduced by the client coverage banker to the company, including risk management and hedging advice in relation to interest rate, energy, or foreign exchange risks; credit rating advice; and corporate restructuring advice. There are product bankers who are responsible for each of these product areas (which are a much smaller source of revenue compared to the capital markets and M&#38;A product areas). Sometimes, the role of the client coverage banker is to encourage a corporate client <i>not</i> to complete a transaction if it goes against the best interests of that client. The banker&#8217;s mission is to become a trusted advisor to clients as they complete appropriate transactions that maximize shareholder value and minimize corporate risk.</p>
<p id="P0580" class="text">In order for client coverage bankers to be helpful to their corporate clients, bankers must first develop strong relationships with corporate CEOs and CFOs, and subsequently with clients&#8217; corporate development and treasury groups. The corporate development group usually reports to the CFO but sometimes directly to the CEO. Their role is to identify, analyze, and execute strategic transactions such as mergers, acquisitions, or divestitures. The treasury group reports to the CFO and focuses on acquiring and maintaining appropriate cash balances, achieving an optimal capital structure for the company, and risk-managing the company&#8217;s balance sheet. This group also manages the company&#8217;s relationship with credit rating agencies summarizes a client coverage banker&#8217;s template for providing investment banking products and services to corporate clients.</p>
<p id="P0585" class="text">Sometimes clients of the Investment Banking Division prefer being covered by bankers who work in geographical proximity to the client. As a result, some client coverage bankers may be assigned to cover clients based on a geographic coverage model rather than through an industry coverage model. Each investment bank attempts to coordinate the activities of industry coverage and geographic coverage bankers in an effort to meet client preferences and achieve operating efficiency for the bank.</p>
</div>
</section>
<section>
<div id="S0050">
<h3 class="h2hd" id="ST0055">Capital Markets Group</h3>
<p id="P0590" class="textfl">The Capital Markets Group is comprised of bankers who focus on either equity capital markets or Debt Capital Markets.<sup><a role="doc-noteref" epub:type="noteref" href="#FN0010" id="CFN0010">1</a></sup> At some investment banks, these two groups coordinate their activities and report to the same person, who oversees all capital markets transactions. At other banks, the two groups report to different individuals and remain fairly autonomous. The Capital Markets Group operates either as a joint venture between the Investment Banking Division and the Trading Division or is included solely within the Investment Banking Division. When issuers need to raise capital they work with a team <span id="page_8" aria-label="Page 8" epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak"/>comprised of a client coverage banker and a capital markets banker. The capital markets banker &#8220;executes&#8221; the capital raising by determining pricing, timing, size, and other aspects of the transaction in conjunction with sales professionals and traders in the Trading Division, who are responsible for creating investment products that meet the needs of their investing clients.</p>
<section>
<div id="S0055">
<h4 class="h3hd" id="ST0060">Equity Capital Markets</h4>
<p id="P0595" class="textfl">Equity Capital Markets (ECM) is comprised of bankers who specialize in common stock issuance, convertible security issuance, and equity derivatives. Common stock issuance includes initial public offerings (IPOs), follow-on offerings for companies that return to the capital markets for common stock offerings subsequent to issuing an IPO, secondary offerings for major shareholders of a company who wish to sell large &#8220;blocks&#8221; of common shares for which the proceeds are received by the selling shareholders and not by the company, and private placements (that do not require registration with a regulator). Convertible security issuance (see Chapters 3 and 9) usually takes the form of a bond or preferred share offering, which can be converted (either mandatorily or at the investor&#8217;s option) into a predetermined number of the issuer&#8217;s common shares. Equity derivatives enable companies to raise or retire equity capital, or hedge equity risks, through the use of options and forward contracts.</p>
<p id="P0600" class="text">Bankers in ECM work closely with client coverage bankers to determine suitable corporate targets for these equity-related products. After helping companies decide to complete an equity financing, ECM assumes primary responsibility for executing the transaction. This involves close coordination with sales and trading professionals in the Trading Division to determine the investment appetite of their client base, which includes institutional and individual investors. In essence, ECM intermediates between the Investment Banking Division&#8217;s issuing clients who want to sell securities at the highest possible price and the Trading Division&#8217;s investing clients who want to buy securities at the lowest possible price. This poses a challenge that requires considerable dexterity to balance competing interests and structure an optimal equity-related security.</p>
<p id="P0605" class="text">ECM and client coverage bankers must consider many issues with their corporate clients before initiating a transaction, including credit rating impact and whether the offering will be &#8220;bought&#8221; by the investment bank (with the resale price risk borne by the bank), or sold on an agency basis (with the price risk borne by the issuer). In addition, they focus on capital structure impact (including cost of capital considerations), earnings per share dilution, likely share price impact, shareholder perceptions, use of proceeds and, if it is a &#8220;public offering,&#8221; filing requirements with the SEC (if a U.S. company), among other things. This process can take several weeks to several months to complete, depending on the vagaries of the market and potential issues raised by regulators.</p>

<h4 class="h3hd" id="ST0065">Debt Capital Markets</h4>
<p id="P0610" class="textfl">Bankers in Debt Capital Markets (DCM) focus principally on debt financings for corporate and government clients. Their clients can be grouped into two major categories: <span id="page_9" aria-label="Page 9" epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak"/>investment grade and noninvestment grade issuers. Investment grade issuers have a high credit rating from at least one of the major credit rating agencies (Baa or stronger from Moody&#8217;s; BBB&#160;&#8722; or stronger from Standard &#38; Poor&#8217;s). Noninvestment grade issuers have lower ratings and their debt offerings are sometimes called &#8220;junk bonds&#8221; or &#8220;high yield bonds.&#8221;</p>
<p id="P0615" class="text">DCM bankers stand between corporate or government issuers (with whom relationships are maintained by bankers in the Investment Banking Division) and investors (covered by sales professionals in the Trading Division). Their role is to find a balance between the competing price objectives of issuers and investors, while facilitating communication and providing execution of transactions.</p>
<p id="P0620" class="text">Bankers in DCM work closely with client coverage bankers to determine suitable corporate and government issuer targets and help clients decide timing, maturity, size, covenants, call features, and other aspects of a debt financing. Of critical importance is determination of the likely impact that a new debt offering will have on the company&#8217;s credit ratings and investor reaction to a potential offering.</p>
<p id="P0625" class="text">In the United States, DCM helps clients raise debt in the public capital markets through SEC-registered bond offerings or through privately placed 144A transactions (investors limited to qualified institutional investors). They also serve as the conduit through which a bank loan can be secured, and provide debt risk management services (using derivatives) and advice regarding the potential credit rating impact of a debt issuance.</p>

<h3 class="h2hd" id="ST0070">M&#38;A Group</h3>
<p id="P0630" class="textfl">At some investment banks, the M&#38;A Group is an independent group from the client coverage group while, at other banks, the two are blended. Regardless, most bankers specialize in one or more industries. Unlike the Capital Markets Group, which, at some firms, is a joint venture between the Investment Banking Division and the Trading Division, the M&#38;A Group always falls under the sole responsibility of the Investment Banking Division.</p>
<p id="P0635" class="text">The principal products of the M&#38;A Group include: (a) &#8220;sell side&#8221; transactions, which involve the sale or merger of an entire company or disposition of a division (or assets) of a company; (b) &#8220;buy side&#8221; transactions, which involve the purchase of an entire company or a division (or assets) of a company; (c) restructurings or reorganizations that focus on either carving out businesses from a company to enhance shareholder value or dramatically changing a company&#8217;s capital structure to either avoid bankruptcy or facilitate a sell side transaction; and (d) hostile acquisition defense advisory services (see <a href="#T0030">Table 1.6</a>).</p>
<p id="P0640" class="text">M&#38;A bankers develop strong valuation analysis and negotiation skills, and they usually work directly with a company&#8217;s CEO, CFO, and corporate development team. Fees are typically paid to M&#38;A bankers only on successful completion of a transaction (although in the case of buy side, restructuring, and defense advisory services, a nominal retainer fee may be charged during the period of the engagement).</p>

<h2 class="h1hd" id="ST0075">Trading Division</h2>
<p id="P0645" class="textfl">The Dodd-Frank Act of 2010 had a significant impact on the trading divisions of investment banks. The Act required changes in the areas of proprietary trading and principal investments (see <a href="#T0030">Table 1.6</a> for a complete description of the Dodd-Frank Act). The Trading Division is responsible for the following:</p>
<div>
<ul>
   <li class="bulllist" id="U9420">&#8226;&#160;<a id="P0650"/>All investment-related transactions with institutional investors, including financial institutions, investment funds, and the cash management arms of governments and corporations</li>
<li class="bulllist" id="U9425">&#8226;&#160;<a id="P0655"/>Taking proprietary positions in fixed income and equity products, currencies, commodities, and derivatives</li>
<li class="bulllist" id="U9430">&#8226;&#160;<a id="P0660"/>Market-making and clearing activities on exchanges</li>
<li class="bulllist" id="U9435">&#8226;&#160;<a id="P0665"/>Principal investments made both directly and through managed funds</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p id="P0670" class="text">This division typically operates in three different business areas: Fixed Income, Currencies, and Commodities; Equities; and Principal Investments. At some investment banks, Principal Investments activity is conducted from a different division. Research on economics, fixed income, commodities, and equities is also provided by the Trading Division to investing clients (see Chapter 6 for more information on the research function and its regulatory history).</p>
<section>
<div id="S0075">
<h3 class="h2hd" id="ST0080">Fixed Income, Currencies, and Commodities</h3>
<p id="P0675" class="textfl">Fixed Income, Currencies, and Commodities (FICC) makes markets in and trades government bonds, corporate bonds, mortgage-related securities, asset-backed securities, currencies, and commodities (as well as derivatives on all of these products). At some firms, FICC is also involved in the provision of loans to certain corporate and government borrowing clients (in coordination with the Investment Banking Division). The business also engages in proprietary (nonclient-related) transactions in the same product areas. Individuals who work in the client-related area of FICC are either traders, who price these products and hold them in inventory as a risk position, or sales professionals, who market trade ideas and bring prices from the traders to investors to facilitate purchases and sales of the products.</p>
</div>
</section>
<div id="page_11" aria-label="Page 11" epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak"/>
<section>
<div id="S0080">
<h3 class="h2hd" id="ST0085">Equities</h3>
<p id="P0680" class="textfl">The Equities desk makes markets in and trades equities, equity-related products, and derivatives in relation to the bank&#8217;s client-related activities. The business generates commissions from executing and clearing client transactions on global stock, option, and futures exchanges. Equities also engages in proprietary (nonclient-related) transactions in the same product areas. As is the case in FICC, individuals who work in the client-related area of Equities are either traders or sales professionals.</p>
<p id="P0685" class="text">Investment banks typically have a Prime Brokerage business that provides bundled services such as securities borrowing and lending, financing (to facilitate leverage), asset custody, and clearing and settlement of trades to hedge fund clients and other money managers. Prime brokers provide fund managers with a centralized location for the clearing of securities, reporting, and financing, while also allowing them to trade with other brokers. Although initially an equity-centric business, Prime Brokerage has expanded its capabilities to many other asset classes (in step with the diversification of strategies employed by hedge funds). A large part of Prime Brokerage-related revenue comes from commissions from executing and clearing client trades by the sales and trading professionals in Equities. Other revenue sources include earning spreads on financing and lending activities. Refer to Chapter 5 for a more detailed discussion of Prime Brokerage and its services.</p>

<h2 class="h1hd" id="ST0090">Nonclient-Related Trading and Investing</h2>
<h3 class="h2hd" id="ST0095">Principal Investing</h3>
<p id="P0690" class="textfl">In addition to their most important role of acting as intermediaries to their investing clients, large investment banks have historically invested in securities and real estate either directly or by coinvesting in a fund offered to clients. For example, the Principal Investments division within Goldman Sachs historically invested in public and private companies in the same way as KKR, a large private equity firm. However, the Dodd-Frank Act now bars investment banks from running principal investments through funds and requires that these investments be limited to direct investments only. Banks can still provide seed investments to funds, but their share in the fund must decrease to below 3% within one year (or within two years in special circumstances).</p>
<p id="P0695" class="text">Moreover, a bank&#8217;s total investment in funds must not exceed 3% of Tier 1 Capital. Principal investment frequently involves purchasing public companies using equity provided by investment banks and debt provided through loans or bonds underwritten by them. <span id="page_12" aria-label="Page 12" epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak"/>This process is called a leveraged buyout (LBO) or &#8220;taking a company private&#8221; in the case of a publicly traded target (see Chapter 16 for more information about LBOs). The combined fair market value of financial instruments owned by, and unfunded commitments of the Principal Investments area of, Goldman Sachs exceeded $27 billion at the end of 2010. In addition to control investments, Goldman Sachs also purchases minority positions in companies. For example, the firm owned common shares of Industrial and Commercial Bank of China Ltd. (one of China&#8217;s largest banks), which have been valued in excess of $5 billion, as well as preferred shares of Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group (one of Japan&#8217;s largest banks), which have been valued in excess of $1 billion. See Table 1.7 for a summary of Goldman Sachs&#8217; principal investments.</p>
<section>
<div id="S0095">
<h3 class="h2hd" id="ST0100">Proprietary Trading</h3>
<p id="P0700" class="textfl">In addition to making principal investments as described in the preceding, most major investment banks have historically made short-term, nonclient-related investments in securities, commodities, and derivatives for their own account. This &#8220;proprietary&#8221; investment activity is similar to the investment activities of hedge funds. Indeed, investment banks&#8217; proprietary investing activities have competed directly with hedge funds for investing and hedging opportunities worldwide.</p>
<p id="P0705" class="text">During 2005 and 2006, investment banks&#8217; proprietary investing contributed in a significant way to robust Trading Division earnings. During 2007 and 2008, however, this trading activity contributed to very large losses at many banks. During the four-quarter period ending in April 2008, investment banks suffered over $230 billion in proprietary trading losses. As these losses continued to grow during the rest of 2008, investment banks significantly curtailed their proprietary investment activity. Investment banks have experienced a number of scandals involving rogue traders who lost very large amounts of money while engaging in proprietary trading. For example, J&#233;r&#244;me Kerviel, a trader who had been working for Soci&#233;t&#233; G&#233;n&#233;rale, lost approximately $7 billion in January 2008. A proprietary trading mishap also occurred at UBS in September 2011, when a trader lost approximately $2.3 billion in trading in futures contracts. The risk had been concealed by the trader&#8217;s creation of fictitious hedging positions. While most banks made positive profits through <span id="page_13" aria-label="Page 13" epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak"/>their trading desks in 2009 and 2010, the future of proprietary trading will change due to the Dodd-Frank Act, which will significantly limit investment banks&#8217; activity in this arena.</p>
</div>
</section>
<section>
<div id="S0100">
<h2 class="h1hd" id="ST0105">Asset Management Division</h2>
<p id="P0710" class="textfl">The Asset Management business offers equity, fixed income, alternative investments (e.g., private equity, hedge funds, real estate, currencies, and commodities), and money markets investment products and services to individuals and institutions. Investments are offered in the form of mutual funds, private investment funds, or separately managed accounts, and are sometimes commingled with the bank&#8217;s own investments. Revenues are created principally based on fees that are paid by investors as a percentage of assets under management (AUM), which vary depending on the asset class. At times, investors pay an incentive fee to the investment bank when returns exceed a predetermined benchmark. Most firms have a Private Wealth Management business organized alongside the Asset Management business, reporting to the same division head. The professionals in the Private Wealth Management business act as advisors to investors, helping them decide how to invest their cash resources. In most cases (but not all), investors will be encouraged to invest in funds managed by the firm&#8217;s asset management teams. However, advisors have a fiduciary obligation to direct investments into the funds (internal or external) that best meet the risk and return objectives of investors. Chapter 6 provides a more detailed discussion of the Asset Management business.</p>
<section>
<div id="S0105">
<h3 class="h2hd" id="ST0110">Coinvestments in Asset Management Division Funds</h3>
<p id="P0715" class="textfl">(see <a href="#T0025">Table 1.5</a>) Investment banks make direct investments in certain funds managed by their Asset Management Division. Within the &#8220;Alternative Assets&#8221; area of this division, investment banks invest in internally managed funds that focus on (1) private equity (LBOs and other equity <span id="page_14" aria-label="Page 14" epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak"/>control investments), (2) hedge fund&#8211;type investments, and (3) real estate. Investment banks typically invest their own capital alongside the capital of their high-net-worth individual and institutional clients in these funds (and they charge investing clients both management fees and performance fees based on the clients&#8217; AUM). This has become a very large business for some investment banks. For example, as of January 1, 2009, two of the largest hedge funds in the world were managed by the Asset Management Divisions of J.P. Morgan and Goldman Sachs (see <a href="#T0025">Table 1.5</a>).</p>
